  # FIXME:
  #   Weaver API shouldn't be one doing docker run (jobs), but it is actually the one
  #   running the cwltool app from the received WPS Execute request sent by the worker.
  #   Configs must be moved to the 'worker' with implementation of direct job monitoring.

      # WARNING:
      #   Working and output directories must be mounted as exact same path (e.g.: /some/path:/some/path)
      #   to avoid mismatching locations between container-side path resolution of cwltool stagedir/tmpdir/outdir

      #   running inside this docker (not docker-in-docker), but next to it (sibling-dockers).
      #   Mapping of paths is needed because some part of the code runs inside Weaver/Worker containers, but actual
      #   execution of the children Application Package of CWL processes calls 'docker run' from the host machine
      #   and will expect to find the same directory locations.
